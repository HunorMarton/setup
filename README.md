# setup

My macOS development setup... dotfiles, config, preferences, apps. Everything 🐙

## Setting it all up

I always configure a new machine by:

1. configure up [SSH and Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
2. open the Terminal and install developer tools required for git by running `git -v`
3. clone this repository: `mkdir git && cd git && git clone git@github.com:HunorMarton/setup.git && cd setup`
4. run the install script: `bash install.sh` (if it fails, follow the intructions and run it again)
5. ☕️
6. follow the last manual setup instructions printed after running `install.sh`
7. verify and fix any brew issues: `brew doctor`
8. restart
